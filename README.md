Final Project on Linguistic Landscapes for my Social Linguistics course @ CU Denver

## (2.0) Materials and methods
### (2.1) The geographical space

The geographical space in Greater Denver Area that was elected for this study is a relatively rectangular map that exists between Colfax Avenue to the North, Havana to the East, Hampden/285 to the South, and Kipling to the West. Although these four major roads were carefully elected as the bounds of the experiment, the space of the study stretches slightly beyond each of the roads in order to contain linguistic storefront features on all sides of their respective intersections.

This elected space, which henceforth be referred to as ‘South Denver,’ is inhabited primarily by Denver county (Appendix A), but it also reaches into portions of Arapahoe County towards the East and Jefferson County towards the West. In terms of city divisions, the ‘South Denver’ space  is once again primarily dominated by the (southern half of) the City of Denver. However, the space technically stretches outside the bounds of Denver proper: on the East side of the South Platte the allotted space also stretches slightly into the City of Aurora; on the West side of the South Platte the allotted space also contains the City of Sheridan and portions of the City of Lakewood. Portions of the City of Englewood are split across the East and West sides of the South Platte, but the proportion is much higher on the East side.

The South Platte River through South Denver was elected as the centerpiece of this study. The South Platte--although not a large river--parallels two high-traffic highways (I-25 and Hgwy 85, culminating to a portion of 'Route 85'), as well as many parks and open spaces: this will henceforth be referred to as the 'South Platte Barrier'. Within the bounds of elected space, there are only 10 roads that pass across the South Platte Barrier--which averages out to about one road every 0.64 miles.

Although the South Platte Barrier is not a major geographical barrier when compared to, say, the Rocky Mountains, or the Mississippi river in Memphis Tenesse, there is a bottleneck friction associated with crossing it, for all of the traffic is funneled into only 10 roads; also, the barrier (especially further North) inhibits foot and bike traffic since many of the roads that cross it are bridges with high-speed vehicle traffic. However--more than anything else--the South Platte Barrier represents a social barrier between the East and West sides. If demographic groups are distinguished on either side, people of any demographic are less likely to cross that barrier when they move.(I need to find >1 article on Linguistic Landscapes to site.)
